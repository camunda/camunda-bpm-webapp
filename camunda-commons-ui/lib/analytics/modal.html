        <h3>Enable Telemetry Data</h3>
        <p>
            At Camunda we want to collect telemetry for the purpose of enhancing your experience. Data helps Camunda
            understand how the product is being used, which parts of the engine need improvement and which features we
            should implement next. </p>
        <p>
            Telemetry also helps our team better understand the reasons why you use Camunda. With this knowledge we are
            able to deliver more value to our community and to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            By enabling telemetry you can:
